# COVID19-BOT(Beds On Track)

Considering the pandemic situation we are up with an idea to keep a track of bed counts in the hospital and the count of testing facilities available in the nearby Testing centre. The data can be updated periodically through the respective logins of Hospitals and Testing centres. The users can look for the nearby hospitals or testing centres by entering their pincode and also book an appoinment. Paytm Gateway is enabled to collect payments from users. 

Health & Family Welfare Department of Tamil Nadu released [StopCoronaTN](https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/beds.php) which covers a similar idealogy. It was really exciting to see that Our idea had a picture. Hope to bring on a lot more...
